Orchestration Roadmap
=====================

1. Ingest (Done)
   - Sources configured via config/sources.json (Raindrop collections, YouTube playlists/handles, RSS feeds)
   - Runs twice daily via GitHub Actions (03:00 & 13:00 UTC)
   - Raw manifests stored under data/raw/<date>/<timestamp>/

2. Enrich (Done)
   - Normalize items across sources
   - Generate summaries with OpenRouter (cached in data/cache/summaries.json)
   - Output enriched payloads to data/enriched/<date>/<timestamp>/items.json

3. Classification (In Progress)
   - Project profiles stored in projects/<project> (project.json + prd.md + changelog.md)
   - Load project context, PRD, usefulness criteria, prompt hints
   - Score each enriched item (High / Moderate / Archive), capture reasoning & next steps
   - Persist results to data/curated/<date>/<timestamp>/items.json and cache classifications

4. Publishing (In Progress)
   - Convert curated data into knowledge.json + knowledge.graph.json
   - Commit to VibesTribe/knowledgebase using KNOWLEDGEBASE_TOKEN
   - Upload graph + digest artifacts (optional)

5. Digest & Notifications (In Progress)
   - Filter High/Moderate items per project
   - Build daily Brevo email payload (10AM Waterloo)
   - Include project change notes (from changelog)

6. Admin UX (Future)
   - Project dashboard in kb-site to view/edit project status, PRD
   - Filters to view bookmarks by project, usefulness, source
   - Buttons to trigger orchestrator workflows on demand

7. Automation Enhancements
   - Raindrop token refresh flow using client ID/secret + refresh token
   - AI assistance to propose PRD updates / usefulness criteria changes

Notes
-----
- Update cron timings in .github/workflows/pipeline.yml if schedule changes
- Add new sources by editing config/sources.json (handles auto-resolve)
- Run `npm run pipeline` locally for dry runs prior to enabling new stages
