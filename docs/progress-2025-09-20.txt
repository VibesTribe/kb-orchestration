Progress Snapshot – 2025-09-20
==============================

kb-orchestration
----------------
- Ingest ? Enrich ? Classify ? Publish ? Digest stages complete and scheduled.
- OpenRouter fallback chain in place (grok-4-f ? deepseek-v3.1 ? nemotron-nano-9b-v2 ? mistral-7b).
- Raindrop token refresh workflow runs every 10 days and updates `RAINDROP_TOKEN`.
- Publish pushes `knowledge.json` / `knowledge.graph.json` to VibesTribe/knowledgebase when `KNOWLEDGEBASE_TOKEN` is present.
- Digest generates artifacts and emails via Brevo when secrets are configured.

kb-site
-------
- Styling locked in from recent redesign.
- Working on wiring live classification data + project/usefulness filters into `App.tsx`.
- Builds fail currently because old + new JSX blocks coexist; need to finish cleanup.
- `final vibeflow prd.txt` is staged but will be removed once UI work finishes.

Next Steps
----------
1. Clean `src/App.tsx` so the new card layout compiles and uses live assignments.
2. Remove the redundant PRD file from kb-site.
3. Commit/push kb-site once `npm run build` passes.
4. After UI cleanup, move on to admin UX (project controls/model usage) and further automation enhancements.
